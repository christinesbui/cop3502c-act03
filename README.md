implementing several different sorting algorithms

### details
iâ€™ve been given a scattered list of small monsters present in the Knightrola region. i need to evaluate six means of comparison-based sort to get these monsters in order.\
i will implement six sorts for the monster structure: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, and merge sort switching to insertion sort at n less than equal to 25.

### data structures and prototypes
integer-sorts-template.c - contains implementation code for bubble, selection, and quick sorts against integer arrays. implement merge sort and insertion sort here first!\
monster-sorts-template.c - contains the shell for sorting monsters via all six sorts.
